# Fintech-Profitability Optimization

## Introduction and Goal:

Welcome to the Fintech-Profitability Optimization project, where we delve into the loan performance data of a Company XYZ to optimize merchant pricing models and enhance overall profitability. Our goal is to analyze loan performance data, identify profitable categories, and recommend pricing strategies to increase the company's profitability.

## Data Details:

The data comprises loan performance data summarized by the merchant. Every merchant is paying a 2% MDR (merchant discount rate) to Company XYZ for each transaction.

## Analysis:

In our analysis, we harness the power of advanced Excel techniques, such as pivots, graphs, and data analysis functions, to thoroughly explore the loan performance data. Our investigation spans various aspects, including dissecting profit patterns across merchant categories, unraveling the distribution of profit among these categories, and uncovering insights into merchant classifications based on transaction volume and Fico scores. By delving into these intricacies, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics driving profitability within the company.

## Highlights:

Key highlights of our analysis and recommendations include:

### 1. Profit Distribution:

Less number of transactions in high segments drive most of the profit.

### 2. Merchant Incentives:

Recommendations to incentivize high-sized merchants with good Fico scores by reducing MDR.

### 3. Tiered MDR Approach:

Introduction of a tiered approach to MDR accounting for risk/reward and incentivizing medium-sized merchants to become high-sized.

### 4. Repayment Rate Analysis:

Consideration of repayment percentages to update merchant segments before Fico updates.
